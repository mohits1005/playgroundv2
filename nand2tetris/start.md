Nand to Tetris

working computer
- hardware (part 1) 7 weeks
- software (part 2) 7 weeks

Repeat
worry about single level
take lower level as given
implement higher level
test that it works

Goal
using Nand gates, build computer that can run Tetris

Build complete functioning computer

Part 1
start with Nand
create HACK computer

Part 2
Start with HACK computer
Create software hierarchy that
runs applications like Tetris

Roadmap

From Nand to HACK

Building a computer called Hack
Hack computer
ROM <> CPU <> RAM

Connect HACK computer to keyboard, monitor

Writing a program journey

low level of hardware - electronics, logic gates; bottom up

Electrical engineering

Abstract Hardware

Nand logic gate

Nand > Combination logic > Sequential logic > Computer architecture

Assembler for Hack computer, low level code

How to build chip?

Building a chip design

XOR chip (outputs 1 if all 1 else 0)

logic diagram = chip diagram

write in form of HDL Hardware Description Language

HDL program + test script > Hardware simulator

Weekly projects

week 1 - elementry logic gates
week 2 - arithmetic logic unit
week 3 - registers and memory
week 4 - writing low level program
week 5 - computer architecture
week 6 - develop assembler

Result = Hack computer

Part 2
Hack to Tetris

create high level language Jack, compiler for it
